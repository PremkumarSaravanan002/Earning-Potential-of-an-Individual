# Earning-Potential-of-an-Individual
**Earning Potential Prediction using Machine Learning:**

This is a data mining project that predicts the earning potential of individuals using three different machine learning algorithms: **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**. The project was developed by [Premkumar S](https://github.com/PremkumarSaravanan002), [Viswa Vengata Baalan M](https://github.com/vishwabaalan07/), and [Uma Maheswari G](https://github.com/uma-giriraj).

**Dataset:**

The dataset used in this project is the [Adult Income dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult), which contains information about individuals' demographic, education, and work-related attributes. The dataset was preprocessed using Python and the Pandas library.

**Machine Learning Models:**

We developed three different machine learning models for this project:

1. **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**: A type of neural network that can handle sequential data.

2. **Gated Recurrent Units (GRU)**: A variant of RNN that uses gating mechanisms to selectively remember or forget information from previous time steps.

3. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**: A class of feedforward neural networks that can learn complex patterns and relationships between inputs and outputs.

We used Python and the TensorFlow library to implement and train these models on Google Collaboratory.

**Results:**

We evaluated the performance of our models using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our experiments showed that the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) model achieved the highest accuracy, with an accuracy of *83%*.

**Usage:**

To use our code, you can clone this repository and run the ANN.py, RNN.py, GRU.py script. The script will preprocess the dataset, train the machine learning models, and evaluate their performance.
